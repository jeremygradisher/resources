## Within my rails 7 application, what does running `yarn install` do?

## ChatGPT answer:

Running `yarn install` in your Rails 7 application is essentially the way to install the JavaScript dependencies defined in your project's `package.json` file, similar to how you would use `bundle install` to install Ruby gem dependencies specified in your `Gemfile`.

Here's a breakdown of what `yarn install` does:

It reads the `package.json` file in the root directory of your project to determine the JavaScript packages your project depends on. These packages can include libraries, frameworks, or other tools necessary for your application.

It then uses this information to download and install those packages into a `node_modules` directory in your project.

Yarn also creates or updates a `yarn.lock` file, which is used to lock down the versions of the packages that your project depends on. This ensures that everyone working on your project uses the same versions of the dependencies, which helps prevent "it works on my machine" type of issues.

Finally, any scripts specified in the `postinstall` field of the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file are run.

Note that starting with Rails 6, Rails began using Webpacker by default to manage JavaScript assets, and Webpacker relies on Yarn as the package manager. If your Rails 7 app was generated with default settings, it is already set up to use Yarn and Webpacker.
