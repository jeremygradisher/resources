A "Google dork” is an advanced Google search technique. “Google dorking” (aka “Google hacking”) is the activity of performing advanced searches on Google. You can combine different Google dorks to comb data otherwise inaccessible to ordinary users of Google search.

On a browser, if you make too many Google searches in a short time, Google requires that you unscramble garbled letters in an image called a captcha before you can proceed. Captcha completion can frustrate end users like you, but Google servers must nip denial-of-service cyberattacks in the bud.

```
site: - restricts search results to the site or domain.
inurl: - searches for the specified term in the URL.
intitle: - searches for the specified term in the page title.
intext: - searches for the specified term in the text of a page.
filetype: - searches for specific file types.
link: - searches for external links to pages.
info: - presents some information that Google has about a web page.
cache: - shows the version of a web page as it appeared when Google crawled the site last time.
related: - lists web pages that are similar to the web page.
stock: - searches for a stock ticker symbol.
```

Here are a few examples of how these operators can be used:
```
site:wikipedia.org
intitle:"index of"
inurl:admin
filetype:pdf "history of the internet"
intext:"password" filetype:txt
link:www.example.com
```
