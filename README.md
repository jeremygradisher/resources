Other notes:

    Bundles the app into static files for production.

# Github Resources - Git Resources

Add gitignore:

```
Open Terminal.

Navigate to the location of your Git repository.

Create a .gitignore file for your repository.

$ touch .gitignore
If the command succeeds, there will be no output.
```

If you want to ignore a file that is already checked in, you must untrack the file before you add a rule to ignore it. From your terminal, untrack the file.
```
$ git rm --cached FILENAME
```

Potential additions to your .gitignore:
```
# Compiled source #
###################
*.com
*.class
*.dll
*.exe
*.o
*.so

# Packages #
############
# it's better to unpack these files and commit the raw source
# git has its own built in compression methods
*.7z
*.dmg
*.gz
*.iso
*.jar
*.rar
*.tar
*.zip

# Logs and databases #
######################
*.log
*.sql
*.sqlite

# OS generated files #
